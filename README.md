# BC_ConservationCorridors

This repository generates a conservation network based on McRae et al
2016
<https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/oregon/science/Documents/McRae_et_al_2016_PNW_CNS_Connectivity.pdf>.

The analysis uses a human footprint/human disturbance layer, and a
‘source’ layer that weights land/water cover according to how likely
they will provide habitat. These are generated by the GitHub repo -
<https://github.com/bcgov/BC_HumanFootprint>.

The analysis invokes Omniscape
(<https://docs.circuitscape.org/Omniscape.jl/latest/>), built in
Circuitscape (<https://circuitscape.org>), to generate the conservation
network.

### Usage

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, a
run_all.R script is used to control their execution, an additional scipt
03_analysis_tiles.R is provided to explore the use of tiles to increase
analysis resolution:

-   01_load.R
-   02_clean.R
-   03_analysis_tiles.R
-   03_Omni_analysis.R
-   04_output.R

### Project Status

This project is part of a Provincial conservation assessment being led
by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. The analysis
is exploratory.
